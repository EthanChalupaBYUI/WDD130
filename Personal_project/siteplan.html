      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>There is an issue with online media in the form of TV shows and Movies at the moment. It Is difficult to find a specific movie or TV show in the sea of streaming services on the market. Having a place to simply look up the name of the media you wish to watch and receiving a list of the streaming services that currently show that media would be a time saver to many people. This service could be funded by ads or by services paying to be higher up on the search list. Data could also be harvested and sold to advertisers. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience off this website is anyone that uses multiple streaming services and is annoyed by having to search them all for the media they want to watch. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People should use my site to find the media that they want to watch. In the home page they should be confronted with a simple interface that is convenient. The site is competing with scrolling through multiple apps or sites to find a show, and if the site is just as painful to navigate then nobody will use it. A few links will be used at the top of the page in the header, and a logo and search bar will be the only thing the user needs to interact with.
    If I were to do this for real I would need to find a list of the media on each service. Then I would need to make a scraper for all the important information for each service and compile that into a database. Then I would use a library to handle backend searches and then make a dynamic website to create a filled page 2. 
    Ads would be used at first to monetize the site. It wouldn't be that expensive to run, so maybe it would be self-sustaining for a while. Then if I got enough traffic I could maybe run sponsored blocks at the top of a users search.
    An app might be useful. Im not that familiar with app development but maybe a ported web app and a copy of the most recent database would be enough for offline use without much development time.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        Once they input their search they will be taken to page 2 where they will see the closest match to what they entered. Because I have no experience with backend I will make a mock up of what that page would contain. Rows will contain each item and in that row there will be columns for a thumbnail of the media,  the name, the services that media is available on, and maybe the date released and average rating.
      </p>
    

      
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Page three will be a more in depth look at the media you picked. A bigger picture of the films cover will be on the right, a title and description in the middle and links to available services on the left.
